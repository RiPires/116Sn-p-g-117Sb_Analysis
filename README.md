# 116Sn(p,g)117Sb_Analysis

Repository containing experiment data files, analysis scripts and simulations, over the proton capture on 116Sn cross-section determination, using the activation method, at astrophysicaly relevant energies for the p-process, comparing gamma- and X-rays emission yields.

# CNA directory
Irradiation and Decay data files for each activation energy run at CNA. As well as Calibration files of the HPGe and SDD detectors used. Scripts for data analysis.

# CTN directory
Irradiation and Decay data files of the activation run at CTN. As well as Calibration files of the BEGe and SDD detectors used. Scripts for data analysis.

# DetSim directory
Development of Geant4 simulations of the HPGe, BEGe and SDD detectors used at CTN and CNA. Simulation of detectors efficiency and ROOT scripts for analysis.
